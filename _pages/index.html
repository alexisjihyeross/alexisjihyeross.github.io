Hi, I'm Alexis! I am currently a first-year <strong>PhD student</strong> at <strong><a href = "https://www.csail.mit.edu/">MIT CSAIL</a></strong>, affiliated with the <a href = "https://lingo.csail.mit.edu/">Language and Intelligence lab</a>. I am supported by the Shillman Fellowship. 

Before starting at MIT, I did research for two years as a <a href = "https://allenai.org/predoctoral-young-investigators">predoctoral researcher</a> on the <a href = "https://allennlp.org/">AllenNLP team</a> at the <a href = "https://allenai.org/">Allen Institute for AI (AI2)</a>. I graduated from <strong>Harvard University</strong> in 2020 with a joint B.A. in <strong>Computer Science</strong> and <strong>Philosophy</strong>.

<br><br>

My email is <strong>alexisro [at] mit [dot] edu</strong>. If you have questions about my work or want to discuss other research/academia-related topics, please feel free to reach out!
