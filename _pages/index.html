I'm a senior at Harvard University studying Computer Science and Philosophy. My research interests are natural language processing and interpretability/explainability of machine learning. In particular, I'm interested in understanding the kinds of knowledge represented in complex machine learning models and in developing methods to make such models more understandable to humans.
