Hi, I'm Alexis! I am currently a third-year PhD student at <a href = "https://www.csail.mit.edu/">MIT CSAIL</a> advised by <a href = "https://www.mit.edu/~jda/">Jacob Andreas</a> and affiliated with the <a href = "https://lingo.csail.mit.edu/">Language & Intelligence lab</a>. I am grateful to be supported by an <a href = "https://www.nsfgrfp.org/contact/about-grfp/">NSF graduate research fellowship</a>. These days, I spend most of my time thinking about how to build NLP methods that can help support <b>education</b>, with a particular interest in methods that can adapt to individual students (see <a href = "https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.718/">here</a> for some work in this direction).

<br><br>

Before starting at MIT, I was a <a href = "https://allenai.org/predoctoral-young-investigators">predoctoral researcher</a> at the <a href = "https://allenai.org/">Allen Institute for AI (AI2)</a>. I have also interned at Microsoft Research. I graduated from Harvard University in 2020 with a joint B.A. in Computer Science and Philosophy.

<br><br>

<b>I am looking for undergrads who are interested in working on education!</b> If you are interested in chatting about AI+education, feel free to reach out at alexisro [at] mit [dot] edu.
