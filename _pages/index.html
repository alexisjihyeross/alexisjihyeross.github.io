Hi, I'm Alexis! I'm a recent graduate from Harvard, where I studied Computer Science and Philosophy. Currently, I'm a Predoctoral Young Investigator on the <a href = "https://allennlp.org/">AllenNLP team</a> at the <a href = "https://allenai.org/">Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2)</a> working with Matt Peters and <a href = "https://www.anamarasovic.com/">Ana Marasovic</a>. My research interests include explainability and interpretability in machine learning--I'm interested in studying what kinds of language understanding existing models do and do not have, as well as in developing methods to help us understand how they make their predictions.

<li>Summer 2017: I was a research assistant in the <a href = "https://cogneuro.psychology.fas.harvard.edu/">Cognitive Neuropsychology Lab</a> at Harvard, where I worked on object processing with <a href = "https://uclouvain.be/fr/repertoires/gilles.vannuscorps">Gilles Vannuscorps</a> and <a href = "https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/alfonso-caramazza">Alfonso Caramazza</a>.</li>
