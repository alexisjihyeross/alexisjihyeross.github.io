Hi, I'm Alexis! I'm a Predoctoral Young Investigator on the <a href = "https://allennlp.org/">AllenNLP team</a> at the <a href = "https://allenai.org/">Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2)</a> working with <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/petersmatthew">Matt Peters</a> and <a href = "https://www.anamarasovic.com/">Ana Marasovic</a>. I'm broadly interested in endowing models with the ability to understand and reason about language in human-like ways. Currently, I'm working on understanding the capabilities of existing state-of-the-art NLP models through work in interpretability and explainability.

<br><br>

I recently graduated with a joint degree in Computer Science and Philosophy from Harvard, where I wote a senior thesis on causal explanations of machine learning models, advised by <a href = "https://himalakkaraju.github.io/">Hima Lakkaraju</a> and <a href = "https://scholar.harvard.edu/bernhardnickel">Bernhard Nickel</a>. I've spent time at Microsoft Research interning on <a href = "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-hanover/">Project Hanover</a> with <a href = "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/tristan/">Tristan Naumann</a> and <a href = "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/hoifung/">Hoifung Poon</a> on biomedical machine reading for precision medicine. I've also been fortunate to have worked closely with <a href = "https://cs.brown.edu/people/epavlick/">Ellie Pavlick</a> and the rest of the <a href = "https://jsalt18-sentence-repl.github.io/">Sentence Representation Learning Team</a> at JSALT 2018.
