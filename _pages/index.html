I'm currently a Predoctoral Young Investigator on the <a href = "https://allennlp.org/">AllenNLP team</a> at the <a href = "https://allenai.org/">Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2)</a> working with <a href = "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/tristan/">Matt Peters</a> and <a href = "https://www.anamarasovic.com/">Ana Marasovic</a>. I am currently working on developing methods to explain the decisions of NLP classifiers. I recently graduated from Harvard with a joint degree in Computer Science and Philosophy.
