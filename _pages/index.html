Hi, I'm Alexis! I am currently a first-year PhD student at <a href = "https://www.csail.mit.edu/">MIT CSAIL</a> advised by <a href = "https://www.mit.edu/~jda/">Jacob Andreas</a> and affiliated with the <a href = "https://lingo.csail.mit.edu/">Language & Intelligence lab</a>. These days, I spend most of my time thinking about how to build NLP methods that can help support <b>education</b>, with a particular interest in building on computational models of <b>pedagogy</b>. 

<br><br>

Before starting at MIT, I was a <a href = "https://allenai.org/predoctoral-young-investigators">predoctoral researcher</a> at the <a href = "https://allenai.org/">Allen Institute for AI (AI2)</a>. I graduated from Harvard University in 2020 with a joint B.A. in Computer Science and Philosophy.
