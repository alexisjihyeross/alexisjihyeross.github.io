Hi, I'm Alexis! I am a Predoctoral Young Investigator on the <a href = "https://allennlp.org/">AllenNLP team</a> at the <a href = "https://allenai.org/">Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2)</a> working with <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/petersmatthew">Matthew Peters</a> and <a href = "https://www.anamarasovic.com/">Ana Marasovic</a>. I am broadly interested in endowing models with the ability to understand and reason about language in human-like ways. My current focus is improving and evaluating the robustness of NLP models, particularly using explanations. 

<br><br>

I graduated from Harvard in 2020 with a joint B.A. degree in Computer Science and Philosophy. During my undergrad, I wote a senior thesis on causal explanations of machine learning models, advised by <a href = "https://himalakkaraju.github.io/">Hima Lakkaraju</a> and <a href = "https://scholar.harvard.edu/bernhardnickel">Bernhard Nickel</a>. I have had the privilege of interning at Microsoft Research, where I worked with <a href = "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/tristan/">Tristan Naumann</a>, <a href = "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/hoifung/">Hoifung Poon</a>, and the rest of the <a href = "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-hanover/">Project Hanover</a> team on biomedical machine reading for precision medicine. I have also been fortunate to have worked closely with <a href = "https://cs.brown.edu/people/epavlick/">Ellie Pavlick</a> and the rest of the <a href = "https://jsalt18-sentence-repl.github.io/">Sentence Representation Learning Team</a> at JSALT 2018. 

<br><br>I can be reached via email at alexisr [at] allenai [dot] org.
