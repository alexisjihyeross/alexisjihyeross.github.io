I'm a senior at Harvard University studying Computer Science and Philosophy. My broad research interests are <strong>natural language processing</strong> and <strong>interpretable/explainable machine learning</strong>. In particular, I'm interested in understanding the kinds of knowledge represented in complex machine learning models and in developing methods to make such models more understandable to humans.

<h2>My Experience</h2>
<ul>
<li>I am currently writing a senior thesis in Computer Science and Philosophy on local counterfactual explanations for blackbox classifiers, advised by <a href = "https://himalakkaraju.github.io/">Hima Lakkaraju</a> and <a href = "https://scholar.harvard.edu/bernhardnickel">Bernhard Nickel</a>. My thesis aims to build explanations which preserve causal relationships between variables and classifier predictions.</li>
<li>Summer 2019: I was a research intern at Microsoft Research's Healthcare NeXT on <a href = "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-hanover/">Project Hanover</a>, where I worked with <a href = "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/tristan/">Tristan Naumann</a> and <a href = "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/hoifung/">Hoifung Poon</a> on biomedical machine reading for precision medicine.</li>
<li>Summer 2018: I was a member of the <a href = "https://jsalt18-sentence-repl.github.io/">Sentence Representation Learning Team</a> led by <a href = "https://cs.brown.edu/people/epavlick/">Ellie Pavlick</a> and <a href = "http://www.nyu.edu/projects/bowman/">Sam Bowman</a> at JSALT 2018.</li>
